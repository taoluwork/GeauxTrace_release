# What is GeauxTrace  
Sponsored by National Institutes of Health, GeauxTrace is an App developed by LSU ECE students for contact tracing. It uses Bluetooth signals of smartphones for real-time distance measurement.  We emphasize privacy and security  protection:

* De-identified user inputs: phone numbers and emails are not required to register and report;
* User locations and other personal information are not needed;
* All information are highly-encrypted and the system is protected from hacking.


# Who can participate?
* Anyone interested in this project is most welcomed to participate. 
* Currently, you need an Android device with Android 8.1+ to install our App. Our iOS version will be released soon. 

# How to participate?
1. Download the latest app from our [release page](https://github.com/taoluwork/GeauxTrace_release/releases) or go to our website [www.geauxtrace.com](www.geauxtrace.com).  
2. Install and start the app. For the first time, you will be asked for the permissions. Click OK and allow. 
3. Click Register new account and create your account. You don't have to use real email but your username should follow the email format with "@xx.com". 
    You password should meet the complexity requirement with uppercase, lowercase letters, number and special charactors. 
    NOTE: If you use fake email, there is no way to retrieve password if you forget it.
4. Log in your account and you are ready to go. You can exit the app and there will be a permanent notification displayed in your dock. Please leave the bluetooth on. 
5. Our app will perform contact tracing in the background without need of user interaction. 
6. To completely shut down the app, make sure you log out first and you can kill the app safely. 

# What data are we collecting?
