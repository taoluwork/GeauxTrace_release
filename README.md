# What is GeauxTrace  
Sponsored by National Institutes of Health, GeauxTrace is an App developed by LSU ECE students for contact tracing. It uses Bluetooth signals of smartphones for real-time distance measurement.  We emphasize privacy and security  protection:

* De-identified user inputs: phone numbers and emails are not required to register and report;
* User locations and other personal information are not needed;
* All information are highly-encrypted and the system is protected from hacking.
