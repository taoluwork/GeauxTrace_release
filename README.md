# Who can participate?
Anyone interested in this project is most welcomed to participate. Currently, you need an Android device with Bluetooth to install our App. When you have access to LSU wifi, please let your device connect to it, to let the App connect to our server within LSU. 

# How to participate?
Download the .apk shared in this folder and install it on your Android device. You need to allow installation from unknown apps. 
Register an account using an email. This email will be used as your username and can be used to recover forgotten passwords. For the current test phase, this does not need to be a real email and we recommend you not to reveal your identity here. 
NOTE: Your password complexity should meet the LSU standard as the following.
Length must be greater than 6. 
Must contain at least one lowercase and one uppercase letter. 
Must contain at least one number and one special symbol (!@#$%^&*).

# What data are we collecting?
We will use Bluetooth on your device to detect contact around you. Our app will record that contact log and upload it for research purposes. Your sensitive info like content in devices and locations is not collected.
